# Recommendation-System

I have created 2 types of recommendation systems:

1. Collaborative filtering recommender on Movie dataset

Collaborative filtering is a technique that can filter out items that a user might like on the basis of reactions by similar users. It works by searching a large group of people and finding a smaller set of users with tastes similar to a particular user

2. Item-based recommender on Cuisine dataset

Item-item collaborative filtering, or item-based, or item-to-item, is a form of collaborative filtering for recommender systems based on the similarity between items calculated using people's ratings of those items
